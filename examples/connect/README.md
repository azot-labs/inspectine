# Instance

It's a minimal example of using `azot` to connect to remote Azot API instance. See [examples/instance](https://github.com/vitalygashkov/azot/tree/main/examples/instance) to learn how to run your own instance.

## Quick start

Setup your config in `azot.config.json` file.

Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Run server:

```shell
npm start
```
