# Instance

It's a minimal example of using `azot` to connect to remote Azot API instance in your JavaSript code. See [examples/instance](https://github.com/vitalygashkov/azot/tree/main/examples/instance) to learn how to run your own instance.

## Quick start

Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Go to `index.js` and set your API base URL, secret and client name. Then you can create a session, generate a license request and get keys.
