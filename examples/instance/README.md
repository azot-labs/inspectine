# Instance

It's a minimal example of using `azot` to run your own Azot API instance. See [examples/connect](https://github.com/vitalygashkov/azot/tree/main/examples/connect) to learn how to connect to remote instance.

## Quick start

Setup your config in `azot.config.json` file.

Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Run server:

```shell
npm start
```
