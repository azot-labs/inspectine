# Instance

It's a minimal example of using `orlan` to run your own Orlan API instance. See [examples/connect](https://github.com/azot-labs/orlan/tree/main/examples/connect) to learn how to connect to remote instance.

## Quick start

Setup your config in `orlan.config.json` file.

Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Run server:

```shell
npm start
```
