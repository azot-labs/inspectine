# Instance

It's a minimal example of using `inspectine` to run your own Inspectine API instance. See [examples/connect](https://github.com/azot-labs/inspectine/tree/main/examples/connect) to learn how to connect to remote instance.

## Quick start

Setup your config in `inspectine.config.json` file.

Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Run server:

```shell
npm start
```
