# Remote Session

It's a minimal example of using `okova` to connect to remote Okova API instance in your JavaSript code. See [examples/instance](https://github.com/azot-labs/okova/tree/main/examples/instance) to learn how to run your own instance.

## Quick start

Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Go to `index.js` and set your API base URL, secret and client name. Then you can create a session, generate a license request and get keys.

Run script:

```shell
node index.js
```
