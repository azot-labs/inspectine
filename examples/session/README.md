It's a minimal example of using `okova` to get a license for Bitmovin's Art of Motion Demo.

This logic may be familiar to those who have used [pywidevine](https://github.com/devine-dl/pywidevine?tab=readme-ov-file#usage).

## Quick start

Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Run script:

```shell
node index.js
```
